   <p>The folded paper crease problem has been seen in calculus courses and textbooks for many years. This problem is sometimes chosen as an additional project to demonstrate the ability of students to apply mathematical concepts to real-world scenarios. As a first year calculus student, I was introduced to this problem as an extra credit project, during which I discovered that the domain and range bounds of this problem are more complex than they appear. In my initial online research, I was not able to find much information on the details of the solution to this seemingly innocuous problem. I actually ended up scoring above the allowable maximum for my solution to this problem, and I would like to share my findings with other students, teachers, and math enthusiasts. It is the intention of this site to clarify the steps and details involved in solving this type of problem. The problem is explained as it was presented in the course below.</p>

   <p><b>Project Name: Minimum Length</b> </p> <p> Due: Thursday, March 23, 2017 (At the start of class) </p> <p> This project amplifies the need to be algebraically sound as a foundation for success in using basic calculus concepts. This project carries a total of 15 points, which will be added to the total of your four test scores in calculating your final grade. In essence, these 15 points are bonus points. Points are distributed as shown below, with 2 points given for presentation (clear, chronological). Show all your work. Your project may be handwritten.</p>
   <p><b>Description:</b> A legal-sized sheet of paper (8.5 inches by 14 inches) is folded so that the lower left corner touches the opposite 14-inch edge. (see figure below)</p>
